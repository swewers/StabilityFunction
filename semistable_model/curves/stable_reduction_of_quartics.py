Stable reduction of plane quartics
==================================

This module implements the computation of the *stable reduction* of a
smooth plane quartic over a p-adic number field, restricted to the case of
*non-hyperelliptic reduction*.

Given a homogeneous quartic form `F` over a number field `K` and a p-adic
valuation `v_K` on `K`, the main entry point
:func:`stable_reduction_of_quartic` carries out the following steps:

1. Construct a GIT-semistable model of the plane quartic with respect to `v_K`,
   using the machinery provided by
   :class:`~semistable_model.curves.plane_curves_valued.PlaneCurveOverValuedField`.

2. Compute the special fibre of this model over a finite extension of the residue
   field, and test whether the resulting curve is stable.  If the special fibre
   is not stable, the reduction is hyperelliptic and the computation stops.

3. Resolve each cusp of the special fibre and determine whether the corresponding
   exceptional divisor is an elliptic tail or a pigtail.

4. Construct the component graph of the stable curve using
   :func:`component_graph_of_GIT_stable_quartic`, and classify its combinatorial
   type via canonical signatures.

The output is packaged in a lightweight container class
:class:`StableReductionResult`, which records the most important intermediate
objects (GIT model, special fibre, component graph) together with the final
reduction type.  The class is designed to be easy to inspect interactively and
to allow later serialization for large-scale experimental computations.

At present, only the non-hyperelliptic case is handled; if hyperelliptic
reduction is detected, this is recorded in the result object.

.. todo::

    - Look into the assumption made in :mod:`semistable_model.curves.cusp_resolution`
      that the ideal `J` has dimension `0`. There are examples where this is false!
    - Improve the performance of :func:`semistable_model.curves.approximate_factors.ApproximateRoot'
      by simplifying the coefficients of a polynomial before evaluating it on the
      approximate root.

def stable_reduction_of_quartic(F, v_K, compute_matrix=False):
    r""" Return the stable reduction of a smooth quartic.
    
    INPUT:

    - ``F`` -- a form of degree `4` in three variables over a number field `K`
    - ``v_K`` -- a p-adic valuation on `K`

    It is assume that `F` defines a smooth plane quartic `X`.

    OUTPUT:

    An instance of :class:`StableReductionResult` describing the geometric stable
    reduction of ``X`` with respect to ``v_K``.

    The returned object has one of the following statuses:

    - ``status == "ok"``:
      The special fibre of a GIT-semistable model of ``X`` is stable and
      non-hyperelliptic.  In this case the result object contains, among other
      data:
      
        * the GIT-semistable model and its special fibre,
        * the component graph of the stable curve,
        * the canonical signature of this graph,
        * the reduction type as a string (one of the 42 genus-3 types).

    - ``status == "hyperelliptic"``:
      The special fibre is not stable, which in genus 3 corresponds to
      hyperelliptic reduction.  No component graph is produced in this case.

    - ``status == "fail"``:
      An exception occurred during the computation.  The exception message is
      recorded in the ``warnings`` attribute of the result object.

    If ``compute_matrix`` is ``True`` then for each cusp/tail we record a triple
    `(v_L, E, T)`, where `v_L` is the valuation on the field extension over
    the cusp could be resolved, `E` is the tail (a semistable plane cubic)
    and `T` is the base change matrix representing the resolution.

    If ``compute_matrix` is ``False`` then instead a triple `(v_L,E, e)` is 
    recorded, where `E` is as before, `v_L` is the valuation on a subextension
    and `e` is a positive integer indicating the ramification index necessary
    to obtain the actual extension.

    ALGORITHM (overview):

    1. Construct a GIT-semistable model of ``X`` with respect to ``v_K`` and
       compute its special fibre over a finite extension of the residue field.

    2. Test whether the special fibre is stable.  If not, record hyperelliptic
       reduction and stop.

    3. For each cusp of the special fibre, compute the resolution and determine
       whether the corresponding exceptional divisor is an elliptic tail or a
       pigtail.

    4. Build the component graph of the resulting stable curve and classify its
       combinatorial type via canonical signatures.

    NOTES:

    - Only the non-hyperelliptic case is handled at present.
    - The function is designed for expensive computations; the result object is
      intended to be inspected interactively or stored for later analysis.

    data describing the stable reduction of `X` with respect to `v_K`, 
    if `X` does not have hyperelliptic reduction. If it has hyperelliptic 
    reduction then ``None`` is returned.

Approximate factors of polynomials over (fake) p-adic number fields
===================================================================

Let `K` be a number field and `v_K` a nontrivial discrete valuation on `K`.
Let `\hat{K}` denote the completion of `K` with respect to `v_K`.

A polynomial `f\in K[x]` is called *strongly irreducible* if it is
irreducible over `\hat{K}`. Given `f\in K[x]`, a *strong prime factor* of `f`
is a monic irreducible factor `g\in\hat{K}[x]` of `f`.

This module provides functionality for computing arbitrarily precise
approximations of all strong prime factors of a given polynomial
`f\in K[x]`. It uses, in an essential way, the theory of MacLane on
inductive valuations which is already implemented in Sage.


A *MacLane* valuation is a discrete pseudovaluation `v` on `K[x]` extending `v_K`
and such that `v(x)\geq 0`. Recall that the set `V_K` of all MacLane valuations 
forms a partially orderd set, and that this poset is a *rooted tree*. Its least
element of the *Gauss valuation*.

Given a monic, integral (with respect to `v_K`) and strongly irreducible 
polynomial `g\in K[x]` there exists a unique MacLane pseudovaluation `v_g`
such that `v_g(g)=\infty`. This is a maximal element of `V_K`.
    
A MacLane valuation `v` is called an *approximate factor* of `f` if there exists
a strong prime factor `g` of `f` such that `v\leq v_g`. It is called an 
*approximate prime factor* if there is a unique such factor `g`, and then it
is called an *approximation* of `g`.

In our implementation, a strong prime factor `g` of `f` is represented by one of
its approximations. Such an approximation can be improved, using MacLane's method,
and any sequence of improvements will converge towards the 'true' prime factor `g`.


EXAMPLES:

    sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
    sage: v_2 = QQ.valuation(2)
    sage: f = x^6 + 4*x + 1
    sage: F = approximate_factorization(f, v_2); F
    [approximate prime factor of x^6 + 4*x + 1 of degree 2,
     approximate prime factor of x^6 + 4*x + 1 of degree 4]
    
    sage: g = F[0]
    sage: g.approximate_factor()
    x + 1

We see that the degree of the prime factor is not necessary equal
to its first approximation. But it is after one improvement:

    sage: g.improve_approximation()
    sage: g.approximate_factor()
    x^2 +1 

You can also force the approximation to have a guaranteed 
precision:

    sage: g.approximate_factor(10)
    x^2 - 28/11*x + 7/23

The *precision* of this approximation beeing `\geq N` means that
the valuation of the difference between a root of the approximation
and the nearest root of the true prime factor is `\geq N`. This is
of the same rough magnitude as the valuation of the approximation,
but may not be equal to it: 

    sage: g.precision()
    21/2

    sage: g.valuation()(g.approximate_factor())
    23/2

Resolution of cusps on plane models of plane curves.
====================================================

EXAMPLES:

    sage: R.<z,x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ, ("z","x","y"))
    sage: v_2 = QQ.valuation(2)
    sage: F = 2*z**4 + 2*x*y*z**2 - x**3*z + y**2*z**2 + x**4 + y**4

This form represents an integral plane model of a smooth quartic over `\QQ`,
whose special fiber with respect to the `2`-adic valuation has a cusp in
normal form in `(1:0:0)`. We can resolve this cusp as follows:

    sage: v_L, t, E, e = resolve_cusp(F, v_2)

Here `v_L` is the unique extension of `v_2` to a finite extension `L` of `K=\QQ`,

    sage: v_L.domain()
    Number Field in alpha with defining polynomial a^8 + 13464*a^7 + 21040*a^6 - 6832/5*a^5 + 93040*a^4 + 39360/43*a^3 + 2820928*a^2 - 10112/443*a - 10816/367

`t` is the thickness of the node where the tail is attached to the core,

    sage: t

`E` is the *tail*, a semistable plane cubic in Weierstrass normal form,

    sage: E
    Projective Plane Curve over Finite Field of size 2 defined by x^3 + y^2*z + y*z^2,

and `e` is a positive integer, the ramification index needed for an extension `L'/L`
over which the resolution can be performed.

TODO: 

- experiment with different variable orders in R to compare performance.

def resolve_cusp(F, v_K, compute_matrix=False, return_J=False):
    r""" Return a base change matrix resolving the cusp.

    INPUT:

    - ``F`` -- a trivariat form of degree `\geq 3` over a field `K`
    - ``v_K`` -- a nontrivial discrete valuation on `K`

    It is assumed that 
    - `F` defines a smooth quartic curve `X`,
    - `F` is integral and primitive with respect to `v_K`, so that it defines
      an integral model `\mathcal{X}` of `X`, and
    - the special fiber has a cusp in normal form at the point `P=(1:0:0)`.

    OUTPUT:

    If ``compute_matrix`` is ``False`` (the default):

    a tuple `(v_L, t, E, e)`, where 
    - `e` is a positive integer,
    - `v_L` is an extension of `v_K` to a finite field extension `L/K` 
      such that the cusp can be resolved over any extension of `L`
      with ramification index `e`, 
    - `t` is a positive rational number, the *thickness* of the node, and 
    - `E` is a semistable plane cubic over the residue field of `L`, 
      the resulting one-tail. 

    If ``compute_matrix`` is ``True``:

    a tripel `(v_L, t, E, T)`, where v_L`, `t` and `E` are as above, with `e=1`,
    and `T` is an upper triangular`(3,3)`-matrix over `L`,
    representing the base change to the plane model resolving the cusp `P`.
